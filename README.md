# EXPLANATION

These are TextMate syntax highlighting files that work with Sublime Text 2.

I pilfered them from other repos on GitHub, after searching for ones that were compatible.

* Updated by [n00ge](https://github.com/n00ge/sublime-text-haml-sass)
	- Added SASS (Windows).sublime-build, SASS (OSX).sublime-build, SASS (Linux).sublime-build, sasswatch.bat, and the Snippets folder
