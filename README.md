EXPLANATION:

These are TextMate syntax highlighting files that work with Sublime Text 2.

I pilfered them from other repos on GitHub, after searching for ones that were compatible.

* Updated by n00ge
	- Added SASS (Windows).sublime-build, SASS (OSX).sublime-build, SASS (Linux).sublime-build, sasswatch.bat, and the Snippets folder
	- The build files will run 'sass --watch .:.' on the current SASS file in Sublime when running Build via Tools > Build or by pressing F7


INSTALLATION:

1. Go to menu bar: "Sublime Text 2 > Preferences > Browse Packages..."
   - Alternate method, on OS X, in Terminal:
   - $ cd ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages

2. Once that folder is open, close Sublime Text 2.

3. Move the two directories: /SASS/, and /Ruby Haml/ to that folder.

4. Restart Sublime Text 2.
